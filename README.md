# A Vulkan Module for Jai

Just a module to use Vulkan in Jai. Both the header and the loader are generated from vk.xml by the code in this repository.

## [Header](vulkan_header.jai)

Not much to say about [the header](vulkan_header.jai). It should just pick up the types from vk.xml and try to format them in Jai with some hopefully useful comments.

## [Loader](vulkan_loader.jai)

There is instructions for usage of the loader in [the file itself](vulkan_loader.jai). It defines globals that will hold the procedure pointers to the API procedures. Then by using the three `load_vulkan_*` procedure you'll be able to fill all these global procedure pointers and start using them.

## Notes

- **I have only been able to test this on Windows** so far. Should be fairly simple to test on other platforms and modify the header/loader if required. Any problems you encounter please report here in an issue or contact me. The current example also has only been done in Windows, even though the platform specific code is mainly limited to creating a surface and should be easy to shape to your platform. **This will be looked at**.

## License

I want people to be able to just use this without thinking about licensing, although give me a shout if you do use it and attribution is appreciated ðŸ˜Š. Replicating STB's (https://github.com/nothings/stb) licensing stuff where you can choose to use public domain or MIT.
