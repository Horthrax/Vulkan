Just a module to use Vulkan in Jai. Both the header and the loader are generated from vk.xml by the code in this repository.

I want people to be able to just use this without thinking about licensing, although give me a shout if you do use it and attribution is appreciated ðŸ˜Š. Replicating STB's (https://github.com/nothings/stb) licensing stuff where you can choose to use public domain or MIT.
